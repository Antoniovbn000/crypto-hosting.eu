                        All our services include a 14 day refund policy.
                        If the first 14 days have been exceeded since the initial first payment, we cannot offer any refund.
                        If we suspect abuse of this policy we may hold the refund for up to 5 business days or it will be paid out in account credits.
                        Refunds after 3 days of usage of our service will receive a partial refund based on the remainder of the billing cycle.
                        Refunds have to be done through the billing panel, by creating a ticket there.

                        The use of chargebacks, disputes is heavily disregarded and by the following term will be considered violatory of the terms.

                    <p>
                        In the event of a chargeback shall the provider terminate the relationship under caution and in regard towards the lack of communication for proper refund by the client.
                        The outcome of the dispute has no effect or change on the relationship, it shall be terminated before then.
                        Furthermore is the outcome of the dispute negligible towards the relationship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additional or add-on purchases, which are extensions of prior or simultaneously purchased services can and will only be refunded in where the service itself has refund eligibility.

                    <br>
                    <p>In the event where an invoice has been overdue for over 7 days the service(s) will be terminated. Within those 7 days the service was suspended, meaning it was inaccessible to the client but a simple completion of payment could get it reinstated.
                    </p>
                    <p>In occurence of a similar event hereby defined „initial deployment“ where the client deploys a service from the ArkNodes billing system or in any other way applicable, is he given said service instantly with the condition of payment, therefore fulfilment of invoice within 6 hours since the initial deployment or said service will be automatically terminated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Repeated abuse of the aforementioned will result in a complete termination of relationship to the client‘s identity prohibiting further service operation from said client.
